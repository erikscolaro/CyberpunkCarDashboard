# CyberpunkCarDashboard

## Brief

Welcome to the Cyberpunk Car Dashboard project! This initiative aims to create a futuristic dashboard inspired by the aesthetic of Cyberpunk 2077, incorporating its distinctive colors and shapes for the restoration of an old Fiat 127.

The project leverages Rive, an innovative software that allows designers to create interactive designs that can be directly integrated into runtime applications. This approach eliminates the traditional separation between design and implementation phases, resulting in a more efficient and cohesive development process.
